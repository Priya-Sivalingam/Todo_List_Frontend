# Todo_List

## Introduction
Todo list Application using MERN Stack development.

The MERN stack has become a go-to choice for many web development projects, allowing developers to build full-stack applications using JavaScript. MERN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — a powerful combination of technologies that work together seamlessly.

- **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL database, used to store your application’s data.
- **Express.js**: A back-end web application framework for Node.js, handling the server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **React.js**: A front-end JavaScript library responsible for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Provides the runtime environment for running your application’s back-end code.
